List:
when i added the circle inside value, it added little circle bullets to the list and moves it to the right
when i added the circle outside value, it pushed the bullets to the left
when i added the square value, it made the bullets into black squares
when i added the none value, it got rid of the bullets
adding the padding pushed the border in
the padding left pushed it to the right in
setting the padding to 0 makes the words right up against the border
adding the border, padding, margin, and width values make the a dashed black border around each text and push it inside to the right
setting the display to inline makes the text horizontal in the list inside of vertical
setting the display to block makes it a vertical list again
the inline block makes the border around each text in a horizontal list

Columns:
1.adding the float right property centers the text boxes

3.when the div1 goes left and div2 goes right it pushes them to opposite sides of the page
4.when i set it to 60% it makes one of the boxes underneath the other
5. to make the percentages both equal, they work at 41%
6.if the browser gets smaller, the two boxes will go under one another (the right one on top), but if the browser is gets bigger, they stay side by side
7. when i increase the padding and margin, the right box goes on top of the left. when the border is 0 but there is padding, the boxes are close to the edge of the page but there is space between the color box and text.
